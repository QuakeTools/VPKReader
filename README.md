VPKReader
=========

parse valve's vpk file, and selectively extract files in it.

I have used a few program of the same kind, but they couldn't work as my wish.

They might force users to release all files in one vpk even you just need one small file, or just crashed. So I wrote this, wish it could be helpful for you.
